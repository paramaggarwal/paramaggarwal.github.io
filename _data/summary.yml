- Working on Mutual Funds and Groww Balance at Groww. Previously, worked on cult.live at-home workouts at CureFit and multi-language support and pre-order capability at Flipkart.
- Before that, explored revamping HR tools to be data-driven instead of subscription-revenue driven called Caliber, at startup incubator Craftworks.
- In the Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree at Udacity, a team of four of us, drove a car in a simulated environment to obey traffic signs purely based on camera data. I worked on building sensor fusion and localization algorithms as well as sophisticated car control in a simulated environment. I also worked on multiple projects related to lane and vehicle detection as well as traffic sign classification that use deep learning and computer vision techniques.
- As a Web and Mobile App Developer at Myntra Designs, Bangalore, I worked on the PHP to Node.js migration for the desktop and mobile websites. I was the first developer on the iOS app and I eventually helped migrate large parts of the iOS app to React Native. Our team explored conversational interfaces in our incubator lab.
