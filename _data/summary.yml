- I am a UI Engineer III at Flipkart, Bangalore. I work in the User Acquisition & Growth team developing cross-platform experiences.
- Before that at Craftworks, we explored new ideas and converted them to products with the possibility of eventually spinning them out into independent companies. We explored revamping HR tools to be data-driven instead of subscription-revenue driven (called Caliber) - similar to how Gmail had disrupted email services.
- I recently graduated the nine month Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree at Udacity. In the capstone project, a team of four of us, drove a car in a simulated environment to obey traffic signs purely based on camera data. I worked on building sensor fusion and localization algorithms as well as sophisticated car control in a simulated environment. I also worked on multiple projects related to lane and vehicle detection as well as traffic sign classification that use deep learning and computer vision techniques.
- I was a Web and Mobile App Developer at Myntra Designs, Bangalore. I worked on the PHP to Node.js migration for the desktop and mobile websites. I was the first developer on the iOS app and I eventually helped migrate large parts of the iOS app to React Native. I led a team as we explored conversational interfaces in our incubator lab.
